# Flicks

Replacement for RottenTomatoes app used in intro to iOS (swift).

The branch `collection-view` uses a collection view instead of the table view.

There are a few librarires that will make dealing with Json in Swift easier. I am using a json parser library SwiftyJson:

I am also using Fontastic (http://app.fontastic.me/), which gives you a nice way to find and export icons for the app as a custom font.

Its a good idea to check how your app behaves on 3G or slower networks.
